# Yanking Text to Registers

Yanking and deleting text will save the text to the same unnamed
register. Every time you delete a word, your yanked word will be
overwritten. This caused me endless amounts of frustration when I
accidentally deleted a word and had to remember what I yanked earlier.

I learned that you can specify a register to save your yanked word to by
prepending your yank command with `"a`. Where `a` is a register. There
are a number of different registers which do different things. If you
want to learn more read VIM\'s [register
documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/change.html#registers.md).

An example usage is:

`"ayw`

This will save the yanked word to the register `a`. After deleting
various things in your file you can always paste your yanked word by:

`"ap`

You can view the contents of all registers via the `:registers` command.

Even after deleting various words in your file, your yanked word will
always be in register `a`. The VIM wiki has more details on [Replacing a
word with yanked
text](http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Replace_a_word_with_yanked_text.md).
