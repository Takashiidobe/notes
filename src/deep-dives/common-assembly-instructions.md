# Common Assembly Instructions

Jim Keller has remarked that there are about 25 instructions in common
use that all instruction sets need. Let's talk about them.

## x86

- `mov` was about 40%
- `push` was about 10%
- `pop` was about 4%
- `call` was about 7%
- `ret` was about 7%
- `je/jne` was about 3%
- `jmp` was also 3%
- `cmp` was 5%
- `add/sub` was 10%
- `and/or/xor` was 5%
- `lea` was 3%
- `nop` was about 3%

This is about the same for ARM and RISC-V, where moving instructions
were most dominant.
