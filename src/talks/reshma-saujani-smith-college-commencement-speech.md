title: "Reshma Saujani's Commencement Speech at Smith College"
---

people ask me all the time reshma how do I overcome imposter syndrome
class of 2023 I am done answering that question and you all can hold me to it
because you see imposter syndrome it's not my problem to solve
and it's not yours either so today if you'll humor me I want to
squeeze in one last history lesson before we leave this place
let's go back to the 1890s a few short decades after Smith was founded
doctors had identified a never-before-seen medical malady one
that threatened to wreck havoc on the entire female population
that condition was called bicycle face you see the original Michael school had
one gigantic wheel in the front and one tiny little wheel in the back

imagine a hula hoop in a dinner plate not easy to ride
but then Along Comes This revolutionary concept two wheels of the same size
go figure The Power of Equality baby and as a result cycling takes off and it
takes off in Europe and North America and it takes off for women
but the with the rise of women riding the bicycle comes the rise of bicycle face
here are the symptoms of this terrifying condition
these are direct quotes by the way flushed cheeks hard clenched jaw bulging eyes
an expression that is either anxious irritable or best Stoney
that's right long before there was resting face there was resting bike face


now here's the thing it wasn't just women who were riding
bicycles in fact the majority of those who had taken up the hobby were men
but bicycle face that was strictly a woman's disease why
because bicycle face was invented to purely scare women off their wheels
here's what was really going on then the bicycle
became a symbol for a growing feminist movement
all of a sudden women could go further and faster and they didn't need to wait
around for a gentleman to show up with his horseback and give him a ride
suffragists can now meet with one another from town to town and they would
take their signs and they would fix them to the front of their handlebars
because of the bicycle women even started wanting different clothes
Victorian hoop skirts so last season women wanted Breezy Bloomers better for


peddling as one magazine wrote in 1896 to men the
bicycle was merely just a new toy but to women
it was the Steed upon which they rode into the new world
of course it wasn't long before men started seeing bikes as more than just a
new toy too to them bicycles and the behavior they were enabling with
women were jarring dangerous threatening to the status quo
more than a century later we can see bicycle face for what it is or what it was
not a medical mistake but a deliberate tool
strategy wielded by powerful men to put women back in their place to make us
stop peddling ridiculously beside I think that there's something deeper here
I think that there's a lot we can learn about imposter Syndrome from bicycle


face both of them are strategies used to hold
women back and it's up to us to not take the bait
the way our culture talks about imposter
syndrome you also could mistake it for a medical condition but it's not
Leslie Jameson wrote about the origins of the phrase in the New Yorker a few
months ago and she talked about how the two researchers who had first talked
about imposter syndrome didn't call it an imposter syndrome at all
in fact they refer to it as imposter phenomenon and it was based on high
achieving white ladies it was never meant to be pathologized
still like bicycle face before it imposter syndrome was rooted in misogyny
it's no coincidence that the concept first emerged as Title IX became law and
women started going to college or that it gained traction just as Roe v


Wade was decided and now that women have control over their bodies
they were starting to enter the workforce in droves
just like bicycle face before imposter syndrome was a reaction to women's
progress but this time the backlash was even more Insidious
which is why today instead of telling you how to overcome imposter syndrome
we're going to question the whole concept and I want to do that by breaking down
some lies we're told about an imposter syndrome starting with the big one
that maybe there's something wrong with you
that imposter syndrome is grounded in actual deficiency
imagine you're riding a bicycle up a hill and as you pedal your way to the
top you fixate on your destination and you clench your jaw
doesn't mean that you have bicycle face that means you're riding a bicycle
imposter syndrome is based on the premise that were the problem that if we


feel underqualified it's because we are that if we worry that we don't have what
it takes it's because we don't but in my experience I had found that
discomfort anxiety to just be a natural human reaction
you know when I showed up at that fancy corporate law firm for the very first
time I had not just one but two ivy league postgraduate degrees
but still I felt like everybody was speaking a different language
and that's because they were so many people there had unearned
privileges that I didn't big law firms were built by four people
who didn't look like me so it's normal to feel like you don't fit in
when you don't fit in so as much as I love Taylor Swift it's me hi
I'm not the problem it's not me and it's not my responsibility to fix


the problem that's our second lie that's your job to fix yourself
if your face is flush at the end of a bicycle ride I wouldn't tell you to
powder your nose that's pretty much what we do when it
comes to imposter syndrome that's the message that we send to you all that
it's your job to make it go away or at least cover it up
I'm sure you've heard all the tips and tricks get yourself a mentor learn how
to say no power pose your way to the top there are countless countless books and
articles out there and yes I'm counting my own on that list
for years I too have been telling women how to overcome imposter syndrome
and look none of his bad advice per se I really do believe that we should focus
Less on being perfect and more I'm being brave
but all those shoulds there's just ultimately another burden that we put on
women that is just not solving the problem


a great example of this is a gender pay Gap you know in the United States a
gender pay Gap has not budged in two decades two decades
but still we keep telling women that you all should one by one know your worth
slay your negotiation ask for more when instead we should just be telling
companies to pay women fairly right provide salary transparency offer paid
leave in child care both proven to close the pay Gap companies
not individual women have the power to erase disparities overnight
similarly though when it comes to imposter syndrome the unspoken
assumption is that if you don't stick up for yourself
and you feel like an imposter it's your own fault
it's extraordinarily unfair and it's unhelpful if we really care about


closing the gender gap the problem the solution is just bigger
than any one of us and that brings me to my third and final lie
which is that imposter syndrome is inevitable
so if we don't fix ourselves what do we do we go to the source
the notion of bicycle face was debunked by Dr Sarah Hackett Stevenson she was
the first ever woman admitted to the American Medical Association
she didn't tell women to fix her bicycle face
and she certainly didn't tell them to stop peddling
she challenged the entire premise when as many as 82 percent of women
report feeling imposter syndrome hard to believe that this is just about
individuals imposter syndrome is the result of structural inequality
not individual inadequacy look I've sat across from some powerful dudes

CEOs presidents Senators you name it in that experience has truly been a gift
not because they are smarter than I am but because they're not okay
I told you about the hundreds of thousands of girls that I've taught to
code well any one of them could run circles around these dudes
but it took me 30 years to learn this lesson
and this is why I'm sharing it with you today because right here right now I
need you to know this it's never been about whether we're
qualified enough smart enough prepared enough if you are here today it is
because you are instead it's always been about the
political the financial the culture barriers that are designed to keep us
out of these rooms in the first place it's leaders who look around and tell

women the biggest problem facing you is not child care or paid leave or misogyny
the biggest problem is you which is all to say that imposter
syndrome it's a distraction it's a strategy
it's a way to keep our concentration on our own alleged inadequacies so we don't
turn it towards the sexism the racism the classism the homophobia the
transphobia that is baked into the system in the first place [Applause]
which means our job stay focused to focus Less on fixing ourselves
and more on healing a broken world now for many of you I know this work is
not new marginalized people women of color we've been leading the fight against
systematic Injustice for Generations and your generation has been fighting
the status quo your whole lives so here is the class the task out of you

class of 2023 to know that you are more than good enough
so that you can dedicate your precious limited time on the things that aren't
my great hope is that you will want to take up this
work that you will want to build a better world than the one you inherited
and I am absolutely certain that you are up to the task
because your Smith education has prepares you for this moment
this is a special place for the past four years you've been part
of a community where no team captain no Club president no valedictorian has ever
been held back because of their gender and I know it's bittersweet to leave
that behind but consider this you've had a tiny glimpse
of what the world could be what it should be
now bring that audacity that agency that authenticity to the world Beyond

Northampton because you you are uniquely qualified to make that world a reality
imposter syndrome is modern day bike face
My Hope Is that one day smithy's of the future we'll see them both
as equally laughable just two more failed attempts to hold us back
getting there though will be the work of a lifetime
but I believe that there's one thing you
can do today on the on this first day of the new chapter of your life and every
day moving forward let's ride your bicycle [Applause] and what I mean by that
pursue what you want to pursue as if imposter syndrome is just

two made up words on a page because they are do your work
make your argument lead your movement because there's nothing wrong with you
it's not your job to fix yourself but it is your job to fix the system
and from everything I've heard about this class you're going to do a damn
good job doing it [Applause] because you have what it takes to lead
and you have an entire community if you fall they are right here to pick you up
so start pedaling feel the sun on your face feel the wind in your hair
feel the joy feel the freedom feel the love
