# Godocs

The Go language has a wonderfully comprehensive standard library. There
is documentation for all of it. You can access that documentation
anytime if you have an internet connection via
[https://golang.org/doc/](golang.org/doc/.md).

If you are without an internet connection, you\'re still in luck. Go has
a built-in feature for serving the documentation locally _offline_. Just
run the following command:

    $ godoc

and then visit `localhost:6060`.
