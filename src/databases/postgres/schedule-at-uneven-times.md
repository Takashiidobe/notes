At Uneven Times

# Schedule at Uneven Times

People tend to schedule processes at some even time (either on a 15
minute schedule, or every hour). Thus, the load on a database spikes
during those time periods:

If you need to update something like a database, try to avoid doing it
at an hour or on the fifteen minutes, and do it at some time in between.
