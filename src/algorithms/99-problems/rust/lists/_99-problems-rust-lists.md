Problems Rust Lists

# List Problems

## 1. Write a function `last : 'a list -> 'a option` that returns the last element of a list.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/last_element.rs }}
```

## 2. Find the last but one (last and penultimate) elements of a list.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/last_two.rs }}
```

## 3. Find the kth element of a list.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/kth_element.rs }}
```

## 4. Find the number of elements of a list.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/size.rs }}
```

## 5. Reverse a list.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/reverse.rs }}
```

## 6. Find out whether a list is a palindrome.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/palindrome.rs }}
```

## 7. Flatten a nested list structure.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/flatten.rs }}
```

## 8. Eliminate consecutive duplicates of list elements.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/duplicate.rs }}
```

## 9. Pack consecutive duplicates of list elements into sublists.

```rs
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/99-problems/rust/src/lists/pack_consecutive_duplicates.rs }}
```
