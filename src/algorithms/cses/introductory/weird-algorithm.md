# Weird Algorithm

Next: \[missing-number](missing-number.md)

Consider an algorithm that takes as input a positive integer n. If n is
even, the algorithm divides it by two, and if n is odd, the algorithm
multiplies it by three and adds one. The algorithm repeats this, until n
is one. For example, the sequence for n = 3 is as follows:

3 -\> 10 -\> 5 -\> 16 -\> 8 -\> 4 -\> 2 -\> 1

Your task is to simulate the execution of the algorithm for a given
value of n.

Execute the algorithm and count the steps:

```cpp
{{# include _include/code/algorithms/cses/cpp/introductory/weird-algorithm.cc }}
```
