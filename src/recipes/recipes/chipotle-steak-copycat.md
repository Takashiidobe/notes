# Chipotle Steak (Copycat)

- From: [link](https://www.culinaryhill.com/chipotle-steak-recipe-copycat/)

- Cooking Time: 80 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 3 cloves garlic
- 2 tablespoons adobo sauce ((see note 1))
- 2 tablespoons ancho chile powder ((see note 2))
- 2 tablespoons olive oil (or rice bran oil, plus more for the cooking surface (see note 3))
- 2 teaspoons ground cumin
- 2 teaspoons dried oregano ((see note 4))
- Salt and freshly ground black pepper
- 4 pounds steak (such as sirloin, round steak, or flat iron steak (see note 5))

## Instructions:

To make the marinade, in the bowl of a food processor or blender, add garlic, adobo sauce, ancho chile powder, olive oil, cumin, dried oregano, 1 tablespoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper. Blend until smooth (add water if needed to fully blend the marinade).

In a large zipper-top plastic bag or bowl, add steak and marinade, tossing to coat. Let the beef marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes or up to 12 hours in the refrigerator. Bring to room temperature for at least 30 minutes before cooking.

In a large skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil until shimmering. Add marinated steak to the skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until the temperature reaches 120 to 125 degrees F for rare or 130 to 135 degrees F for medium-rare. Depending on the size of your skillet, you can cook the steak in batches.

Remove to a cutting board and tent with foil for 10 minutes. Chop into small pieces. Season to taste with salt. Serve with your favorite burrito toppings such as rice, beans, guacamole, and salsa.
