- From: [link](https://thebakerupstairs.com/2022/02/instant-pot-clam-chowder.html)

- Cooking Time: 45 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1/2 cup celery (chopped)
- 1 medium onion (chopped)
- 2 teaspoons garlic
- 4 slices thick cut bacon (cooked and crumbled)
- 4-5 potatoes (peeled and cut into 1/2 inch cubes)
- 3 6.5 ounce cans clams
- 1 1/2 cups chicken broth
- 1/2 teaspoon pepper
- 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 1/3 cup flour
- 1 cup half and half
- 1 cup milk

## Instructions:

Add the butter to the instant pot insert and heat on saute mode until melted. Add the celery, onion, and garlic to the pot, and cook 3-4 minutes, until the onions and celery are softened. Add the bacon, potatoes, clams (with the clam juice), chicken broth, pepper, salt, and Old Bay seasoning to the pot. Put the lid on the pot, turn the knob to seal, and cook at high pressure for 20 minutes. Let the pressure naturallly release for 10 minutes, then quick release the remaining pressure.

While the pressure is releasing, make the roux by melting the butter in a small saucepan. Stir in the flour to form a paste. Cook 3-4 minutes, until golden. Slowly stir in the half and half and milk, and cook until thickened. Stir the roux into the clam chowder and mix until blended. Serve hot, topped with oyster crackers.
