# Pasta alla Vodka

- From: [link](https://www.acozykitchen.com/one-pot-vodka-pasta)

- Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1/4 yellow onion (peeled and minced)
- 2 garlic cloves (peeled and minced)
- Kosher salt
- 3 ounces tomato paste (1/2 can)
- 1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes
- 3 ounces heavy cream
- 1 pound pasta of choice (I like tubular pasta in this application)
- 1/2-3/4 cup pasta water (reserved)
- 2 ounces finely grated Parmesan-Reggiano (plus more as garnish)
- 2 tablespoons unsalted butter (straight from the fridge)
- Minced Italian parsley (as garnish)

## Instructions:

In a large saucepan, set over medium-low heat, add the olive oil. When warm, add the minced onion, garlic and a pinch of kosher salt. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.

Pour in the tomato paste, along with the red pepper flakes, and cook it until the tomato paste turns a really dark red color, about 3 minutes. 

Pour in the heavy cream and mix it until smooth. Turn off the sauce. Now, we’re gonna boil the pasta!

Bring a pot of salted water to a boil. You want the water as salty as the sea. Pour in the pasta and cook it until about 1 minute shy of al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of pasta water. Drain the pasta.

Turn the heat up on the sauce to medium. Pour in 1/2 cup pasta water, along with the grated Parmesan-Reggiano and give it a taste. Add salt to taste. I added a pinch or two. Pour in the pasta and then add in the cold butter. Mix it vigorously for 1 minute, until thick and luscious.

Garnish with grated Parmesan-Reggiano and some minced Italian parsley.
