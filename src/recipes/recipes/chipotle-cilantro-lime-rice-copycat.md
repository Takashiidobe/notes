# Chipotle Cilantro Lime Rice (Copycat)

- From: [link](https://www.culinaryhill.com/chipotle-cilantro-lime-rice/)

- Cooking Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients:

- 2 cups basmati rice (unrinsed, or any long-grain white rice, rinsed (see note 1))
- 1 bay leaf
- Salt
- 1 teaspoon olive oil (or rice bran oil, optional)
- 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro (minced (or omit or sub parsley))
- 2 tablespoons fresh lime juice (from 1-2 limes)
- 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice (from 1-2 lemons)

## Instructions:

To cook basmati rice on the stove top:

Bring 8 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add rice, bay leaf, oil if using, and salt to taste (I like 2 teaspoons). Stir and return to a boil. Boil uncovered for 10 to 12 minutes (for me it's always 12, but some readers have reported mushy rice after 12 minutes, so keep an eye on yours).

Remove bay leaf. Using a fine mesh strainer, drain rice and rinse with hot water. Pour into a large bowl.

Stir in cilantro, lime juice, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt (I like an additional 1/4 teaspoon). Serve hot or at room temperature.

To cook any long-grain rice on the stove top:

Bring 4 cups water to a boil in a large pot. Add rice, bay leaf, oil if using, and salt to taste (I like 2 teaspoons). Stir and return to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.

Remove bay leaf. Stir in cilantro, lime juice, and lemon juice. Season to taste with salt (I like an additional 1/4 teaspoon). Serve hot or at room temperature.

To cook long-grain rice in a rice-cooker:

Add rinsed rice (see notes), water (according to manufacturer's instructions, see notes), bay leaf, salt (I like 1 teaspoon), and oil if using. Close rice cooker, plug in, and turn on. Cook according to manufacturer's instructions.

When the rice is finished, remove bay leaf. Stir in cilantro, lime juice, and lemon juice. Add more salt to taste (I like 1/4 teaspoon). Serve hot or at room temperature.

To cook brown rice:

Follow the instructions above using the following times: 40 minutes for Basmati on the stove top, 45 minutes for long-grain on the stove top, and 60 - 70 minutes for a rice cooker (or according to manufacturer's instructions). 2 cups brown rice makes 16 servings, 1/2 cup each (higher yield than white rice).
