# Mango slush with sago (tapioca pearls)

- From: [link](https://cookpad.com/eng/recipes/12367976)

## Ingredients:

- 2 mangoes (slices into small cubes) I separated 1/4 cup for topping. And the rest is for slush
- Sweetened condensed milk (depends on the sweetness you want)
- 1 cup tapioca pearls
- I cup or more ice cubes

## Instructions:

First cook the tapioca pearl according to the package instructions.

Remove from the heat and transfer tapioca pearls to a strainer, rinse under cold running water and then drain well. Set aside.

Using a blender add the mangoes, ice cubes, and one spoonful of sweetened condensed milk.

Blended together until smooth. Taste it. If it’s not sweet enough then add more condensed milk, and blend it again.

For assembly, I like to add crushed ice to my glass, then add the mango mixture, stirring well. Add tapioca pearls, then pour the coconut milk and finally topping with sliced mango. And it’s done, enjoy!

Happy Cooking!
