# How to Get Yourself Promoted

- 🚀 Understanding Promotion: Steve clarifies that promotions are based on
potential rather than past performance. The goal is to demonstrate you're
already performing at the next level.
- 🎯 Project Selection: Choosing the right projects is crucial. Engage in work
that aligns with promotion criteria and has visible impact within the company.
- 📈 Creating a Promo Packet: Document your achievements and contributions
meticulously. Include links to significant work, testimonials, and quantitative
data that highlight your impact.
- 📚 Continuous Learning: Emphasize the importance of learning company systems
and technologies to enhance your effectiveness and readiness for promotion.
- 🤝 Finding a Mentor: Seek guidance from senior colleagues who can provide
insight and potentially advocate for your promotion.
- ✏️  Weekly Snippets: Keep a regular record of your work. This not only helps
with performance reviews but also ensures you have a detailed account of your
contributions for your promotion packet.
- 🔄 Promotion Packet Essentials: Include documentation of your work,
significant code check-ins, and any other deliverables. Utilize graphs, charts,
and numbers to underscore your achievements.
- 🔍 Visibility and Networking: Ensure your contributions are visible not only
within your team but across the organization. Networking with individuals
outside your immediate circle can be beneficial for promotion.

Steve's guidance stresses the proactive management of one's career path, the
strategic selection of projects, and the importance of documenting and
communicating one's contributions effectively. This approach aims to position
individuals for successful promotion within the tech industry.
