# All About Big Tech Interviews

ðŸ”„ The Flawed Process: Steve begins by acknowledging the inherent flaws in the
technical interview process. He criticizes the industry's reliance on
interviews as the primary means of evaluating potential hires, highlighting the
lack of correlation between interview performance and job performance.

ðŸ¤” Interviewer Bias: Steve shares observations that interviewers, including
himself at times, often believe they are exceptional at assessing candidates.
However, he argues this confidence may be misplaced, as statistical analyses at
companies like Google have shown no significant correlation between interview
evaluations and actual job performance.

ðŸ“š The Art of Conducting Interviews: Steve humorously recalls his ambition to
write a book titled "Conducting Technical Interviews," emphasizing the
perceived need for a guide on the subject. Yet, he admits the interview
process's imperfections, suggesting that even a well-intentioned guide could
not solve the fundamental issues.

ðŸŽ­ Interview Dynamics: Steve describes the interview process as trying to
decide whether to marry someone based on a few hours of interaction. This
metaphor underscores the inadequacy of interviews to fully capture a
candidate's potential.

ðŸ“‰ Statistical Insights: Google's statistical analysis revealed two key
findings: interview performances do not predict job performance, and no
interviewer's evaluation is a better predictor than another's. This challenges
the efficacy of the interview process and suggests a need for alternative
assessment methods.

ðŸš« False Negatives and Positives: Steve highlights the issue of false
negatives, where qualified candidates are mistakenly rejected, and false
positives, where unqualified candidates are hired. He argues that the
industry's fear of false positives has led to an overly cautious approach,
resulting in missed opportunities and potential resentment from rejected
candidates.

ðŸ’¡ Rethinking the Interview Process: The episode advocates for a reevaluation
of the interview process, suggesting that more time and varied interactions
with candidates could lead to better hiring decisions. Steve suggests that
relying solely on traditional interviews is insufficient for assessing a
candidate's true potential.

ðŸ“‹ Hiring Committee's Role: Steve elaborates on Google's hiring committee
system, which separates the interviewers' feedback from the final hiring
decision. This method aims to minimize biases by having a dedicated committee
review interview feedback without knowing the interviewers, thus hoping to make
a more objective hiring decision.

ðŸ”„ Bias and Influence Among Interviewers: Traditional interviewing methods,
where interviewers discuss candidates post-interview, can lead to bias and
influence, potentially exacerbating the false negative issue or inadvertently
allowing false positives.

ðŸŽ¯ Efficiency of the Interview Process: Steve critiques the conventional belief
that more interviews lead to better hiring decisions. Google's analysis showed
that beyond four interviews, additional sessions do not significantly improve
the reliability of hiring decisions.

ðŸš« The Challenge of False Negatives and Positives: A significant portion of the
talk is dedicated to the problem of false negativesâ€”qualified candidates being
rejectedâ€”and false positivesâ€”unqualified candidates being hired. Steve argues
that the industry's aversion to false positives leads to an overly cautious
approach that misses out on potential talent.

ðŸ”„ Rethinking Interview Approaches: Steve suggests considering pair interviews,
where two interviewers are present, to enhance the quality and reliability of
the interview. This method can provide a more balanced view of the candidate
and reduce individual interviewer bias.

ðŸ“š The Importance of a Comprehensive Evaluation: Highlighting the limited scope
of interviews in assessing a candidate's overall capabilities, Steve advocates
for a more holistic review, including examining a candidate's past work and
contributions. He shares his personal experience where his contributions
outside of traditional work environments helped secure his position at Google.

ðŸ•° The Value of Time in Assessing Candidates: Echoing his earlier points, Steve
stresses that the only true way to assess a candidate's fit and performance is
by working with them over time. He references Google's past practice of not
assigning a final level or title to new hires until after a probationary
period, arguing that this approach yielded better outcomes by allowing a more
accurate assessment of the employee's fit and capabilities.
