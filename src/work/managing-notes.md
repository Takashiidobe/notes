1. Create atomic notes. Each note should be self-contained and contain just one idea. You can create little notes and link between them.
2. Use templates. Templates can have things like type (person, team, project, quarter, meetings, etc). Be able to one click to create a type of note and then reference it later when you need to create a talk to write an RFC or an ADR.
3. Periodically groom your notes. Resummarize notes into a better form and create bidirectional links between notes.
4. Synthesize new ideas by linking between your old notes and writing up a new idea.
5. Learn how to use Google Docs or Confluence or whatever medium you use for docs and ask the right people for feedback.
