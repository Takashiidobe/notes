# Types of Notes

For work, it's important to have types of notes as a template so you can quickly create new notes.

Some ideas:
- People (jot down notes of people you meet with regularly based on what they say/do)
- Teams (what projects a team has, what sort of work they do, how they interact with you, links to their relevant docs/decision records)
- Projects (your projects, other team's projects, past/present/future evergreen documents that indicate what they do)
	- How to build each project should be noted (normally in the readme, but also)
	- How to run the project (in each environment)
	- How the project is tested
	- What are some common failure modes? (i.e. Runbooks)
	- How is the project monitored? Where are those monitors?
- Quarterly Plans/Planning: What are some high level goals and where do you keep those?
- When writing a document, make sure to call out specific wants/abilities and ones we don't care about.
