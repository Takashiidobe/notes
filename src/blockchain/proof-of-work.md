title: "Proof of Work"

Proof of work involves miners solving cryptographically hard puzzles in
order to get tokens.

One party (the prover) proves to others that a certain amount of
computational effort was expended.

This (in the case of Bitcoin) can lead to large amounts of electricity
expenditure for little gain.
