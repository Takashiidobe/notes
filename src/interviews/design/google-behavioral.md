3. Tell me about a time you were tasked to do the impossible. How did
   you do it?

(- Working extra/on the weekends + long days isn't that great).
(+ Probably better to be clearer on tasks/description).

- Be a team player to keep people in the loop, and focus on
  learning/mentorship.

4. Tell me about a time you received mentorship. What did you learn from
   it? What would you like to continue to learn?

and delegate the work + grow the team).

  learning.

5. A project keeps slipping past deadlines. What do you do?

keep stakeholders in the loop.)

  with stakeholders to resolve problems. Be respectful of other teams,
  but take it in stride.

   on other projects code?

- (Make sure to communicate with stakeholders + why the feature was being

   do?

facing)?

helps to debug some more important issues).
