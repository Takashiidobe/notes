# What is a Mac Address?

A mac address is a unique number that is tied to the NIC of the device. They are 6 octets, generally separated by colons.

It is used to determine how devices should connect to a router in some order. If a computer wants to send a packet to a computer on the same network, it uses the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) to send packets between them.
