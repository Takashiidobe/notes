# SIMD

SIMD = Single Instruction Multiple Data. In x86, AVX/SSE are examples. Hardware supports larger registers, which can allow multiple instructions to be handled at once, as well as hardware to handle multiple different types of operations on those registers.

This can make certain operations (mainly floating point ones, bitshifts, and mathematical operations) much faster.
