# Valid Sudoku

Determine if a 9 x 9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:

    Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.
    Each of the nine 3 x 3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

Note:

    A Sudoku board (partially filled) could be valid but is not necessarily solvable.
    Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the mentioned rules.

Example 1:

```
Input: board =
[["5","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: true
```

Example 2:

```
Input: board =
[["8","3",".",".","7",".",".",".","."]
,["6",".",".","1","9","5",".",".","."]
,[".","9","8",".",".",".",".","6","."]
,["8",".",".",".","6",".",".",".","3"]
,["4",".",".","8",".","3",".",".","1"]
,["7",".",".",".","2",".",".",".","6"]
,[".","6",".",".",".",".","2","8","."]
,[".",".",".","4","1","9",".",".","5"]
,[".",".",".",".","8",".",".","7","9"]]
Output: false
```
Explanation: Same as Example 1, except with the 5 in the top left corner being modified to 8. Since there are two 8's in the top left 3x3 sub-box, it is invalid.

## Solution

To check if a board is a valid sudoku, we create a set of 1 - 9 for
each row, each col, and each square in the board. If there's any number,
we add it to the corresponding row, or col, and square it belongs in. If
we find the same number in either the same row, col, or square, then
this board is not valid.

```python
class Solution:
    def isValidSudoku(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> bool:
        rows = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        cols = [set() for _ in range(9)]
        squares = [[set() for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]

        for row in range(9):
            for col in range(9):
                num = board[row][col]
                if num == ".":
                    continue
                if num in rows[row] or num in cols[col] or num in squares[row // 3][col // 3]:
                    return False
                rows[row].add(num)
                cols[col].add(num)
                squares[row // 3][col // 3].add(num)

        return True
```
