# Merge Two Sorted Lists

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists list1 and list2.

Merge the two lists in a one sorted list. The list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

Return the head of the merged linked list.

Example 1:

```
Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
```

Example 2:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = []
Output: []
```

Example 3:

```
Input: list1 = [], list2 = [0]
Output: [0]
```

## Solution

We can do this iteratively or recursively:

To do this recursively, note that we want to select the node of the two
that has a smaller value (not caring about ties), returning that, and
then setting the head to the merge function of the next value and the
other list.

```python
class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, l1: Optional[ListNode], l2: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not l1: return l2
        if not l2: return l1
        if l1.val < l2.val:
            l1.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1.next, l2)
            return l1
        else:
            l2.next = self.mergeTwoLists(l1, l2.next)
            return l2
```
