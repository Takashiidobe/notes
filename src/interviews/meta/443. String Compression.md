You want to keep track of a read/write pointer, as well as the streak of current characters. Then, after counting the run of the current pointer, you have to go back to the previous pointer and then encode the grouping, making sure to encode each number as its separate digits for some reason.

```python
class Solution:
    def compress(self, chars: List[str]) -> int:
        write = 0  # where we write compressed output
        read = 0   # current position while scanning

        while read < len(chars):
            char = chars[read]
            count = 0

            # count the run of the same character
            while read < len(chars) and chars[read] == char:
                read += 1
                count += 1

            # write the character
            chars[write] = char
            write += 1

            # write the count if > 1
            if count > 1:
                for c in str(count):
                    chars[write] = c
                    write += 1

        return write
```
