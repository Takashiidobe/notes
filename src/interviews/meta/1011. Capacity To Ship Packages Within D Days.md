Try to find the weight and then binary search to find the correct amount of weights.
```python
class Solution:
    def shipWithinDays(self, weights: List[int], days: int) -> int:
        def solveable(capacity: int) -> bool:
            curr = 0
            days_taken = 0
            for weight in weights:
                if curr + weight > capacity:
                    days_taken += 1
                    curr = weight
                else:
                    curr += weight
            return days_taken < days
        
        left = max(weights) 
        right = sum(weights)

        while left < right:
            capacity = (right + left) // 2
            if solveable(capacity):
                right = capacity
            else:
                left = capacity + 1
        
        return right
```
