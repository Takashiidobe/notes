When the question asks for K closest points, a heap or some sort of sorted data structure tends to work out well. Here we chuck them into an array, heapify them, and return the closest points to the origin.

```python
class Solution:
    def kClosest(self, points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        points = [(math.sqrt((p[0] * p[0]) + (p[1] * p[1])), p) for p in points]
        heapq.heapify(points)
        return [heapq.heappop(points)[1] for _ in range(k)]
```
