This question asks to take a unix like path and then shorten it (if possible).
`.` refers to the current directory, and `..` refers to the parent directory (if it exists).
`.` can always be eliminated, and `..` can eliminate a previous dir.

We can apply that algorithm. We split out any consecutive `/` by filtering out the input, and then create a stack of the file paths.

If we see a '.', skip it. If there's a '..', then pop the stack if it exists, otherwise, append it as it is a dir name.

```python
class Solution:
    def simplifyPath(self, path: str) -> str:
        split_path = filter(lambda x: x, path.split('/'))

        stack = []

        for part in split_path:
            if part == ".":
                continue
            if part == "..":
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
                continue
            stack.append(part)

        return "/" + "/".join(stack)
```
