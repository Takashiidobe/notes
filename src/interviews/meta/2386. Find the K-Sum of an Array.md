We want to find the kth sum of subsequences from an array. We can do this by first taking the sum of all the positive numbers in the array (`m`) and then starting off with that as our first sum of a subsequence. Then, we want to make smaller subsequence sums, which can be done by either adding negative numbers or dropping positive numbers (hence why vals is an `abs(num)`). We also want to remove previous visits as well.

 ```python
class Solution:
    def kSum(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        m = sum(num for num in nums if num > 0)
        pq = [(-m, 0)] 
        vals = sorted(abs(num) for num in nums)
        for _ in range(k): 
            num, i = heappop(pq)
            if 0 < i < len(vals): 
                heappush(pq, (num+vals[i], i+1))
                heappush(pq, (num-vals[i-1]+vals[i], i+1))
                continue
            if i < len(vals):
                heappush(pq, (num+vals[i], i+1))

        return -num
 ```
