We can use a Counter to do this quickly, but this is $O(n\log{} n)$.

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
		c = Counter(s)
		return ''.join(sorted(s, key=lambda x: c[x], reverse=True))
```

However we can also just sort the items themselves in the counter itself, which is always only sorting 26 characters at most, so its $O(n)$.

```python
class Solution:
    def frequencySort(self, s: str) -> str:
        freq = Counter(s)
        freq = sorted(freq.items(), key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
        return ''.join([key * val for key, val in freq])
```
