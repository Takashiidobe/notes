For each number, we want to extend the streak, and extend all subarrays that end at this point.
Then we add that to the total count, and return it.

```python
class Solution:
    def zeroFilledSubarray(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
	    total = 0
	    for val, group in groupby(nums):
	        if val == 0:  
	            streak = len(list(group))
	            total += streak * (streak + 1) // 2
	    return total
```
