Postgres is an RDBMS (Relational Database Manamagent System)

SQL constitutes ACID (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable)
transactions, which means that your state will not leak, or be lost,
barring disk corruption - always back up your hard disks.

Postgres is more like a Data Access API and service, allowing you to
build stateless services on top of it.
