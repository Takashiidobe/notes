You A Haskell Chapter 1

# Introduction

## Haskell

- Haskell is a purely functional language.

  - You can only tell it identities and you can\'t mutate state.
  - A function must have no side effects \-- if you call a function
    with the same arguments, it will always return the same result.

- Haskell is lazy.
