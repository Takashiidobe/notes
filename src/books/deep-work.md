Work

# Deep Work

## Part 1

## Introduction

- The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly **rare**
  at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly **valuable** in
  our ecomony. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill with
  thrive.
- A deep life is a good life; taking lessons from Jung (who bought a
  secluded house in 1922 before producing his most valuable research).

## Chapter 1 Deep Work is Valuable

### Three kinds of Winners in the Knowledge Economy

#### Highly Skilled Workers

- Highly skilled workers use technology to amplify their output to do
  things that a normal worker cannot do; like using programming to
  create new products.

#### Superstars

- You cannot stack up average workers to create the output of a
  superstar.
- A Superstar's output is categorically different from those of an
  average worker.
- The open economy is winner-take-all so mediocre work is poorly
  compensated, whereas Deep Work is highly compensated.

#### The Owners

- Those who have capital and make smart investments in rising
  winner-take-all companies will make more more returns on their
  capital.

### How to become a Winner in the new Economy

- The ability to quickly master new things.

- The ability to produce at an elite level, in terms of both quality
  and speed.

- Deep Work helps us quickly learn hard things, and produce at an
  elite level.

High Quality Work Produced = (Time Spent) * (Intensity of Focus).

### Attention Residue

- Frequently task switching leads to some of your attention being left
  behind on the previous task, lowering productivity.

## Chapter 2: Deep Work is rare

- Real Time messaging and E-mail are a drag on productivity.

### The metric black hole

- No one knows how much email costs your team, but for a big
  organization it might cost millions of dollars, if each employee
  takes one hour per day to respond to/read emails.

### The principal of least resistance

- Email is easier than not using email.
- It makes you feel more productive, even when you're not.
- People tend to do easier things first.

### Internet Faith

- People tend to believe technology is all good, even if it is a set
  of tradeoffs.

## Chapter 3: Deep Work is meaningful

- Skillfull management of attention is the **sine qua non** of the
  good life, and the key to improving virtually every aspect of your
  experience.
- Flow is important as well, when we lose ourself in our goals and
  challenges, we produce high quality work.
- The enlightenment has given us the power to control our destiny
  (rather than God). We must find a way to extract meaning from our
  craft to create beautiful and lasting artifacts of work, which leads
  to satsifaction.

## Part 2

## Rule 1: Work Deeply

- We should craft our workplaces to allow for deep work; we can create
  an area with serendipitous meetings, and areas to concentrate for
  deep work.

### Why don't we all work deeply?

- Every day we fight our desires, and so we can't work deeply.
- We must add routine and rituals to help fend off our desires.

### Decide on Your Depth Philosophy

#### Monastic

- Donald Knuth is unreachable my e-mail, he has a PO box that an
  assistant filters for him if you want to reach him.
- He spends all of his time on arcane aspects of computer science,
  only doing deep work.

#### Bimodal

- Carl Jung would follow this, where he had divided his time into deep
  and shallow work times.
- You must allow yourself enough time to do shallow work (run a
  clinic, talking to other academics) while allowing yourself enough
  time for your own deep work.

#### Rhythmic

- Try to chain habits together every day to do more output in a set
  amount of time per day.

#### Journalistic

- Walter Isaacson would spend his few pockets of time (30m-1h) writing
  his biographies (like Steve Jobs).

### Ritualize

- Make rituals to create a boundary between work and relaxation so you
  can recharge during relaxation time.

- Try to find out where to work and how long.
- How long to work.
- How to support work.

#### Making Grand Gestures

- Check yourself into a grand hotel and burn money to get your last
  manuscript done.
- Spend a lot of money on a plane ticket to another place just to get
  that deep work needed.

#### Don't Work Alone

- MIT used to have a lab that would house all kinds of scientists, and
  this serendipitous building created many innovations of the 20th
  century, like radar, chomsky grammar, and video games.
- Talking with colleagues in front of a whiteboard, exchanging ideas
  leads to great innovations.

#### Execute like a Business

1.  Focus on the wildly Important

- The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish.

2.  Act on the Lead Measures

- Lag Measures describe
- Lead measures predict

3.  Keep a Compelling Scoreboard

- Measure the correct metrics and diligently keep score.

4.  Create a Cadence of Accountability

- Keep a rhythm to allow the team to own a wildly important goal.

#### Be Lazy

- Idleness is not just a vacation, an indulgence or a vice; it is as
  indispensable to the brain as Vitamin D is to the body. It is,
  paradoxically, necessary to getting any work done.

1.  Downtime Aids Insights

- The scientific literature believes that some problems are better
  untangled with unconscious thought.

- A group that was distracted while making a big decision instead of
  one that concentrated seemed to do better.

2.  Downtime helps recharge the energy needed to work deeply.

- Simply taking a walk in nature allows us to unwind and replenish our
  **directed attention** which is needed to work deeply.

3.  The Work that Evening Downtime Replaces is not that important

- Deliberate practice can only happen up to four hours per day. Thus,
  when we take a break in the evenings, we should, for that work
  we're replacing is low quality.

## Rule 2: Embrace Boredom

- The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be
  trained. And thus, you must be fine with being bored to hone that
  skill.

### Don't take Breaks from Distraction. Instead Take Breaks from Focus

- Allow yourself time with the internet in some chunks.

### Work Like Teddy Roosevelt

- Identify a deep task that you'd like done for the day that's high
  on your priority list.
- Then, give yourself a hard deadline that drastically lowers the time
  required for this.

### Meditate Productively

- Take long walks with focused thought in order to complete tasks you
  need to get done.
- Make sure not to let thoughts stray, keeping a laser like focus on
  the task at hand.

1.  Beware of Distractions and Looping (reiterating priors to a problem)
2.  Structure your Deep Thinking (start with priors, move onto results,
    then a conclusion).

### Memorize a Deck of Cards

- To Memorize a deck of cards, put each one of the cards in a room in
  your house in your mind. Then, stick each card in the area where you
  would go in order.

For example, taking off your shoes, then sitting down, etc.

## Rule 3: Quit Social Media

- Don't believe in the "Any Benefit" approach to tooling.

- The Any Benefit approach to tooling believes that you should adopt
  any tool that has any positive.

- Instead, think carefully about how to maximize productivity by
  minimizing downsides and distractions.

- Take the Craftsman Approach to Tool Selection: Adopt a tool only if
  its positive benefits to your goals substantially outweigh its
  negative impacts.

### Apply the Law of the Vital Few

- Identify the main high level goals in your professional and personal
  life:

- List the two or three most important activities that help you
  satisfy the goal.

- List out if your tools help you substantially meet these goals, if
  not, purge them.

- 80% of a given effect is due to just 20% of the possible causes.

### Don't use the internet to entertain yourself

- Mental Facilities do not tire like an arm or a leg; self improvement
  in the hours after work help you out more than doing shallow work or
  distracting yourself.

## Rule 4: Drain the Shallows

- Jason Fried (of basecamp fame) believed that his employees did
  better work with less time, since they respected each other's time
  more.
- They take off friday's during the summer, and spend a month where
  employees were allowed to work on any projects that they wanted to
  to improve the company.

### Schedule every part of your day

- At the beginning of every day, cut your day into little blocks of
  time, and assign activities to the blocks.

### Quantify the Depth of Every Activity

- Quantify the work that is required to be deep, by comparing how many
  months it would take to get a college undergrad to speed on the
  task. The less time required, the shallower the work.

### Ask your Boss for a Shallow Work Budget

- Ask your boss for a ratio of limiting shallow work

### Become Hard to Reach

- Turn your email into something that only requires a response if
  something is interesting; Make people more reluctant to send you
  email unless it's interesting, and make it so there's no guarantee
  you'll respond.

- This will help cut out email from your life.
