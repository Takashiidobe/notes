To Solve It Chapter 1

# How to Solve it Chapter 1

## Understanding the Problem

First, understand the problem:

- What is the unknown?
- What are the data?
- What are the conditions?

Is it possible to satisfy the condition? Is a heuristic good enough?

Start by drawing out your understanding of the problem.

## Devising a Plan

- Have you seen this problem before?
- Do you know a related problem? Could it be useful in some way to
  solve this problem?
- Is there any problem you know with similar unknowns?
- Could you use the result of something else?
- Could you restate the problem into something simpler?
- Could you solve part of the problem?
- Could you solve a related problem?
- Could you relax a constraint?
- Could you change the unknowns?

## Carrying out the Plan

- When implementing every step, make sure each step is correct. Can
  you prove it to be correct?

## Looking Back

- Can you check the result of the solution?
- Can you derive the result differently?
- Can you use the result, or method, for another problem?
