# Chapter 2

## Exercise 2-1

> Write a program to determine the ranges of char , short , int , and
> long variables, both signed and unsigned , by printing appropriate
> values from standard headers and by direct computation. Harder if you
> compute them: determine the ranges of the various floating-point
> types.

```

## Exercise 2-2

> Write a loop equivalent to the for loop above without using && or
> ||.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-2/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-3

> Write the function htoi(s) , which converts a string of hexadecimal
> digits (including an optional 0x or 0X) into its equivalent integer
> value. The allowable digits are 0 through 9, a through f, and A
> through F.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-3/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-4

> Write an alternate version of squeeze(s1,s2) that deletes each
> character in the string s1 that matches any character in the string
> s2.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-4/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-5

> Write the function any(s1,s2) , which returns the first location in
> the string s1 where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if
> s1 contains no characters from s2 . (The standard library function
> strpbrk does the same job but returns a pointer to the location.)

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-5/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-6

> Write a function setbits(x,p,n,y) that returns x with the n bits that
> begin at position p set to the rightmost n bits of y, leaving the
> other bits unchanged.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-6/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-7

> Write a function invert(x,p,n) that returns x with the n bits that
> begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa),
> leaving the others unchanged.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-7/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-8

> Write a function rightrot(x,n) that returns the value of the integer x
> rotated to the right by n bit positions.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-8/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-9

> In a two's complement number system, x &= (x-1) deletes the rightmost
> 1-bit in x . Explain why. Use this observation to write a faster
> version of bitcount.

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-9/main.c }}
```

## Exercise 2-10

> Rewrite the function lower, which converts upper case letters to lower
> case, with a conditional expression instead of if-else .

```c
{{# include _include/code/programming-languages/c/the-c-programming-language/chapter-2/2-10/main.c }}
```
