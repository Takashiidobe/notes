# Retrieving System and Process Information

## The `/proc` file system

Unix provides the `proc` virtual file system to investigate processes and metadata about them.

### Obtaining Information About a Process: `/proc/PID`

The kernel provides a directory named `/proc/PID` for each process on the system. In the directory are files and subdirectories containing information about the process. For example, if you cat `/proc/1/status`, you can find information about the `init` process.

```
$ cat /proc/1/status
Name: init Name of command run by this process
State: S (sleeping) State of this process
Tgid: 1 Thread group ID (traditional PID, getpid())
Pid: 1 Actually, thread ID (gettid())
PPid: 0 Parent process ID
TracerPid: 0 PID of tracing process (0 if not traced)
Uid: 0 0 0 0 Real, effective, saved set, and FS UIDs

```

Some interesting information in the `/proc` directory includes:

| File    | Description (process attribute)                                             |
|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| cmdline | Command-line arguments delimited by \0                                      |
| cwd     | Symbolic link to current working directory                                  |
| environ | Environment list NAME=value pairs, delimited by \0                          |
| exe     | Symbolic link to file being executed                                        |
| fd      | Directory containing symbolic links to files opened by this process         |
| maps    | Memory mappings                                                             |
| mem     | Process virtual memory (must lseek() to valid offset before I/O)            |
| mounts  | Mount points for this process                                               |
| root    | Symbolic link to root directory                                             |
| status  | Various information (e.g., process IDs, credentials, memory usage, signals) |
| task    | Contains one subdirectory for each thread in process (Linux 2.6)            |

### The `/proc/PID/fd` directory

This directory contains one symbolic link for each file descriptor that the process has open. Any process can access its own `/proc/PID` directory using `/proc/self`.

### Threads: the `/proc/PID/task` directory

Each thread
