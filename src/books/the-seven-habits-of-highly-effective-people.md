# The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People

Character ethics matter - Integrity, Humility, Fidelity, Temperance,
Courage, Justice, Patience, Industry, Simplicity, Modesty, and the
Golden Rule.

Values are what people remember -- "what you are shouts so loudly in
my ears that I cannot hear what you say."

"For every thousand hacking at the leaves of evil, there is one
striking at the root." Prefer subtance over style.

## Habit 1: Be Proactive

We have the ability to think about ourselves through the lens of another
being. We have to think about how our eprceptions interact with how we
see ourselves, and align them with a healthy perception of ourself.

Frankl, even as he was captured by the Nazis, realized that he was in
control of his self-awareness, even as he had no control of everything
else.

The first habit is to be proactive: to take responsibility. Reactive
people react to their environment. Proactive epople are driven by their
internal values and nothing else.

## Habit 2: Begin with the End in Mind

Envision what you want in the future, so you can work and plan towards
it. Remember your values as you make decisions, since you want to
fulfill your values while making decisions.

## Habit 3: First Things First

Follow this table Ruthlessly:

                  Urgent     Not Urgent

Important Do Plan
Not Important Delegate Eliminate

## Habit 4: Think win-win

Genuine feelings for mutually beneficial solutions should be prioritized
over solutions where one party wins a lot and one party wins nothing.

It's important to resolve conflict by allowing both parties to win a
little bit at a time.

## Habit 5: Seek first to understand, then to be understood

Listen first and understand before seeking to be understood. The Greeks
characterized this in these values:

1.  Ethos - Credibility
2.  Pathos - Empathy
3.  Logos - Logic

Follow this order of understanding ruthlessly.

## Habit 6: Synergize

Set goals that combine the strengths of people. Positive teamwork allows
teams to accomplish more than if they were a separate group. The whole
is greater than the sum of its parts.

## Habit 7: Sharpen the Saw

Always continuously improve -- find ways to judge less, and care more
-- to improve in both technical and interpersonal ways, and learn
something new, to avoid stagnation.
