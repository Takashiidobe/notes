# Induction

**3.1** Prove, using induction but also without it, that $n(n + 1)$ is an even number for every non-negative
  integer $n$.

  ---

  **3.2** Prove by induction that the sum of the first $n$ positive integers is $n(n + 1)/2$.

  ---

  **3.3** Observe that the number $n(n + 1)/2$ is the number of handshakes among $n + 1$ people. Suppose that
  everyone counts only handshakes with people older than him/her (pretty snobbish, isn’t it?). Who will count the
  largest number of handshakes? How many people count 6 handshakes?
  Give a proof of the result of exercise **3.1**, based on your answer to these questions.

  ---

  **3.4** Give a proof of exercise **3.1**, based on figure 3.

  ---

  **3.5** Prove the following identity:
  $1 \cdot 2 + 2 \cdot 3 + 3 \cdot 4 + \dots + (n - 1) \cdot n = \dfrac{(n - 1) \cdot n \cdot (n + 1)}{3}$

  ---

  **3.6** Use the method of the little Gauss to give a third proof of the formula in exercise **3.1**.

  ---

  **3.7** How would the little Gauss prove the formula for the sum of the first $n$ odd numbers $(2)$?

  ---

  **3.8** Prove that the sum of the first $n$ squares $(1 + 4 + 9 + \dots + n^2)$ is $n(n + 1)(2n + 1)/6$.

  ---

  **3.9** Prove that the sum of the first $n$ powers of 2 (starting with $1 = 2^0$) is $2^n - 1$.
