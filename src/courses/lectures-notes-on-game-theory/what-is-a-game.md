# What is a Game?

A game is a mathematical model of a strategic interaction, with the following elements:

- **Players**: Games must have participants. Players can be people, busiensses, teams, political parties, countries, etc.

- **Choices**: Players have to make a choice, or multiple choices between different actions. A strategy is a rule for choosing actions.

- **Outcomes**: When the players are done choosing, an outcome occurs and the game ends. The outcome also must depend on the choices.

- **Preferences**: Players have preferences over outcomes.

Two features are required to make a game strategic:

1. Outcomes are determined by everyone's actions
2. Players have different preferences.

Games differ in a few aspects:

1. **Timing**: Do players choose once? (Rps) Or over and over again? (Chess) Does the game eventually end? Does it continue forever? Do they choose simultaneously, or in turns?

2. **Observations**: Can players observe each other's choices?

3. **Uncertainty**: Is the outcome rnadom, or is it a deterministic function of the player's actions? Do some players have more or less information than others?
