## Induction

Much of our knowledge has to do with reasoning from specific cases to the general case.

We might design an experiment that samples some part of the population, asks them a question, and then generalize that to the whole population.

For example, asking 200 people on a telephone survey, to get information on the opinion of the entire city.

## Model of a process or System

Our interest is in how the input(s) of a process affect the output(s). Input variables consist of:

- **controllable factors** $x_1$: factors measured and changed by the scientist
- **uncontrollable factors** $x_2$: factors measured but not changed by the scientist
- **noise factors** $e$: unmeasured, uncontrolled factors, called variability or error.

For any interesting process, there are inputs such that:

$$ variability in input \to variability in output $$

If variability in an input factor $x$ leads to variability in output $y$, $x$ is considered a source of variation.

## Experiments and observational studies

Information on how inputs affect output can be gained from:

- **Observational Studies**: Input and output variabels are observed from a pre-existing population. It is hard to discern what is input and what is output.
- **Controlled Experiments**: One or more input variables are controlled and manipulated by the experimenter to determine their effect on the output.
