And Throughput

# Latency and Throughput

- Latency (How long a round trip takes) (network, disk, cache)

  - Back of the Envelope Calculations
  - Read 1MB memory 250 microseconds
  - Read 1MB SSD 1,000 microseconds
  - Send 1MB over 1GBps network 10,000 microseconds
  - Read 1MB HDD 20,000 microseconds
  - Packet from CA -\> Netherlands -\> CA 150,000 microseconds

- Throughput (How much work a machine can perform in a given amount of
  time)

- Reduce bottlenecks by increasing the amount of work a server can do.
