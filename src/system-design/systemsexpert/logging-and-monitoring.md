And Monitoring

# Logging and Monitoring

Logging helps for understanding how the system works.

(Google Stackdriver works well here).

## Monitoring

- You can hook up a monitoring system to slack, and have it graph
  times where your system is unresponsive, or resulting in more 4XX
  responses, or 5XX responses than the norm.
