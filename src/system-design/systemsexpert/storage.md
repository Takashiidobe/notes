# Storage

- Databases persist data and retrieve data.
- Most databases do persist data to disk.

There are two types of memory:

## Disk & Memory

### Disk

- Persists to the hard drive. Even if the database crashes, if it
  boots up again, data is saved.

### Memory

- Does not persist data. If the server crashes, the data disappears.
