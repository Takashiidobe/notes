Are Design Fundamentals

# What Are Design Fundamentals?

There\'s a lot of subjectivity in System Design \-- most of the time,
it\'s important to justify your solution and discuss tradeoffs.

Why did you design parts of the system one way vs. another?

Categories of System Design:

Foundational \-- If you don\'t understand the basics, you can\'t answer
any system:

Client/Server Protocol Networking (TCP/IP, UDP)

Characteristics \-- Things you want a system to have

Availability Latency Throughput Redundancy Consistency

Components \-- Tangible things you can implement in a system, like
Leader Election, a Database, Load Balancers, Web Servers

Technology \-- What technologies will you use as components, or to
achieve some requirement of a system:

ZooKeeper or Etcd for Leader Election S3 for Blob Storage EC2 for a
Server Nginx for a Server or Reverse Proxy Redis for a Key-Value Store
