# Using 401ks

A 401k, both traditional and Roth is a good way to contribute to
retirement in a tax privileged account.

However, both accounts normally can only be withdrawn from penalty free
at 59 1/2.

For the traditional 401k, it's possible to either use 72(t) SEPP
(separate equal periodic payments) or a Roth conversion ladder to tap
into your 401k funds before 59 1/2 and minimize fees.

With either method, you would convert money from a traditional 401k to a
Roth IRA and then be able to claim your retirement funds penalty (but
not income tax) free.

For a Roth 401k, however, you cannot dodge the penalty unless you're 59
1/2. Earnings are always taxed and penalized.
