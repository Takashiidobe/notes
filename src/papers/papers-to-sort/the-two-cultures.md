# The Two Cultures

The two cultures is a paper about the growing divide between the humanities and the scientists, as seen by C.P. Snow, a Novelist and Chemist.

He expands on his idea that there are now two cultures with mutually unintelligible ideas: [^1]

This can even lead to strife: [^2]

Snow concludes that this requires bridging between the two cultures: [^3]

[^1]: A good many times I have been present at gatherings of people who, by the standards of the traditional culture, are thought highly educated and who have with considerable gusto been expressing their incredulity at the illiteracy of scientists. Once or twice I have been provoked and have asked the company how many of them could describe the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The response was cold: it was also negative. Yet I was asking something which is the scientific equivalent of: Have you read a work of Shakespeare's?[6] I now believe that if I had asked an even simpler question – such as, What do you mean by mass, or acceleration, which is the scientific equivalent of saying, Can you read? – not more than one in ten of the highly educated would have felt that I was speaking the same language. So the great edifice of modern physics goes up, and the majority of the cleverest people in the western world have about as much insight into it as their neolithic ancestors would have had.

[^2]: The non-scientists have a rooted impression that the scientists are shallowly optimistic, unaware of man's condition.
On the other hand, the scientists believe that the literary intellectuals are totally lacking in foresight, peculiarly unconcerned with their brother men,
in a deep sense anti-intellectual, anxious to restrict both art and thought to the existential moment.

[^3]: There is only one way out of all this: it is, of course, by rethinking our education.
In this country, for the two reasons I have given, that is more difficult than in any other. Nearly everyone will agree that our school education is too specialised. But nearly everyone feels that it is outside the will of man to alter it. Other countries are as dissatisfied with their education as we are, but are not so resigned.
