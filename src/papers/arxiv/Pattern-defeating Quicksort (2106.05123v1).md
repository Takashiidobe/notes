abstract: "A new solution for the Dutch national flag problem is proposed, requiring no three-way comparisons, which gives quicksort a proper worst-case runtime of $O(nk)$ for inputs with $k$ distinct elements. This is used together with other known and novel techniques to construct a hybrid sort that is never significantly slower than regular quicksort while speeding up drastically for many input distributions."
