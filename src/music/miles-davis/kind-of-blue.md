# Background

This LP is considered one of the best Jazz albums of all time, and it delivers. This LP was created by A sextet of Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Julian Adderley, Bill Evans, Paul Chambers, and Jimmy Cobb. Davis was influenced by George Russell's theory on Major and Minor chords and this influenced his previous LP, milestones, in this style, called modal jazz. [^1]

My favorite songs on this LP are So What and All Blues. But they're all great songs.
