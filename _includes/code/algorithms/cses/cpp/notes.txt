houses are inelastic in the short-term so they're hard to sell (buyers and sellers tend to be few and far between) 

as well property can depreciate quite considerably compared to other assets: if your neighborhood becomes undesirable, it's not odd to see property values fall below inflation value.

renting is better for convenience and less risk (i can move anytime i want, it's easier to rent than buy because the capital you need is like 6x rent in your bank account and prices fluctuate less).

Let's look at the house I'm in right now:

If you want a 400k house, at 3% apr over 30 years, my monthly payment is about 1.7k for the mortgage. As well, I need to save about 1% or 4k yearly for repairs (~$300 a month) and my property taxes (in maryland) would be $4,680 (~$400 a month). Homeowner's insurance is about 1.3k or ~$100 a month. So my total costs for this property monthly is about 2.6k a month if I choose to buy.

Should I choose to rent (I'm looking at the value of my own house), a fair price to rent is about 1.8k.

The house I'm in appreciated over the past 20 years at a rate of about 4%. Let's say that's fair. Assuming that continues on for the next 30 years (I doubt it) this house will be worth 1.3M in 30 years. Given that your property tax increases, at the end, my property taxes would be about 1.3k/month.
