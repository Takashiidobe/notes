#
# Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.
# 
# Note:
# Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers
# within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−2^31,  2^31 − 1]. For the purpose
# of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed
# integer overflows.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: x = 123
# Output: 321
# Example 2:
# Input: x = -123
# Output: -321
# Example 3:
# Input: x = 120
# Output: 21
# Example 4:
# Input: x = 0
# Output: 0
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# -2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1
# 
# 
#
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
