# Testcase Example:  '[1,3,null,null,2]'
#
# You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST), where exactly two nodes
# of the tree were swapped by mistake. Recover the tree without changing its
# structure.
# 
# Follow up: A solution using O(n) space is pretty straight forward. Could you
# devise a constant space solution?
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [1,3,null,null,2]
# Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
# Explanation: 3 cannot be a left child of 1 because 3 > 1. Swapping 1 and 3
# makes the BST valid.
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: root = [3,1,4,null,null,2]
# Output: [2,1,4,null,null,3]
# Explanation: 2 cannot be in the right subtree of 3 because 2 < 3. Swapping 2
# and 3 makes the BST valid.
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 1000].
# -2^31 <= Node.val <= 2^31 - 1
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
