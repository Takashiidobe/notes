# Testcase Example:  '[4,2,1,3]'
#
# Given the head of a linked list, return the list after sorting it in
# ascending order.
# 
# Follow up: Can you sort the linked list in O(n logn) time and O(1)Â memory
# (i.e. constant space)?
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
# Output: [1,2,3,4]
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: head = [-1,5,3,4,0]
# Output: [-1,0,3,4,5]
# 
# 
# Example 3:
# 
# 
# Input: head = []
# Output: []
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the list is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
# -10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5
# 
# 
#
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def sortList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
