#
# Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while
# maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
# Minimize the total number of operations.
