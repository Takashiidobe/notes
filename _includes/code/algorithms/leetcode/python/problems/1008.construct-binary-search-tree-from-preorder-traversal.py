# Testcase Example:  '[8,5,1,7,10,12]'
#
# Return the root node of a binary search tree that matches the given preorder
# traversal.
# 
# (Recall that a binary search tree is a binary tree where for every node, any
# descendant of node.left has a value < node.val, and any descendant of
# node.right has a value > node.val.  Also recall that a preorder traversal
# displays the value of the node first, then traverses node.left, then
# traverses node.right.)
# 
# It's guaranteed that for the given test cases there is always possible to
# find a binary search tree with the given requirements.
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: [8,5,1,7,10,12]
# Output: [8,5,10,1,7,null,12]
# 
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= preorder.length <= 100
# 1 <= preorder[i] <= 10^8
# The values of preorder are distinct.
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def bstFromPreorder(self, preorder: List[int]) -> TreeNode:
