#
# Given a binary tree, we install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 
# 
# Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate
# children.
# 
# Calculate the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the
# tree.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# 
# Input: [0,0,null,0,0]
# Output: 1
# Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
# 
# 
# 
# Example 2:
# 
# 
# Input: [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
# Output: 2
# Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the
# tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera
# placement.
# 
# 
# 
# Note:
# 
# 
# The number of nodes in the given tree will be in the range [1, 1000].
# Every node has value 0.
# 
# 
# 
# 
#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
