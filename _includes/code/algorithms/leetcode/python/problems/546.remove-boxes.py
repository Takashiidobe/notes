#
# Given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive
# numbers.
# You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there is no box left.
# Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed
# of k boxes, k >= 1), remove them and get k*k points.
# Find the maximum points you can get.
# 
# 
# Example 1:
# 
# 
# Input: boxes = [1,3,2,2,2,3,4,3,1]
# Output: 23
# Explanation:
# [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1] 
# ----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
# ----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (1*1=1 points) 
# ----> [1, 1] (3*3=9 points) 
# ----> [] (2*2=4 points)
# 
# 
# 
# Constraints:
# 
# 
# 1 <= boxes.length <= 100
# 1 <= boxes[i]Â <= 100
# 
#
