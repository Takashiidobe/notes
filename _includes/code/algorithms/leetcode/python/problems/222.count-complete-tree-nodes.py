# Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
# 
# Note: 
# 
# Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
# In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is
# completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as
# possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
# 
# Example:
# 
# 
# Input: 
# ⁠   1
# ⁠  / \
# ⁠ 2   3
# ⁠/ \  /
# 4  5 6
# 
# Output: 6

#
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def countNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
