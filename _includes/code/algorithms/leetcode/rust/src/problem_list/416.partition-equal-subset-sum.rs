 *
 * Given a non-empty array nums containing only positive integers, find if the
 * array can be partitioned into two subsets such that the sum of elements in
 * both subsets is equal.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,5,11,5]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [1, 5, 5] and [11].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,5]
 * Output: false
 * Explanation: The array cannot be partitioned into equal sum subsets.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 200
 * 1 <= nums[i] <= 100
 *
