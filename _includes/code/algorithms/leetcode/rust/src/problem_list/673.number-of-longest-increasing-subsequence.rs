 * Testcase Example:  '[1,3,5,4,7]'
 *
 * Given an integer arrayÂ nums, return the number of longest increasing
 * subsequences.
 * 
 * Notice that the sequence has to be strictly increasing.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,7]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and
 * [1, 3, 5, 7].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2]
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: The length of longest continuous increasing subsequence is 1,
 * and there are 5 subsequences' length is 1, so output 5.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 2000
 * -10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6
 * 
 *
