 *
 * An integer has sequential digits if and only if each digit in the number is
 * one more than the previous digit.
 * 
 * Return a sorted list of all the integers in the range [low, high] inclusive
 * that have sequential digits.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: low = 100, high = 300
 * Output: [123,234]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: low = 1000, high = 13000
 * Output: [1234,2345,3456,4567,5678,6789,12345]

 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 10 <= low <= high <= 10^9
