 * Testcase Example:  '"zzazz"'
 *
 * Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of
 * the string.
 * 
 * Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.
 * 
 * A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as
 * forward.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "zzazz"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any
 * insertions.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "mbadm"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: String can be "mbdadbm" or "mdbabdm".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "leetcode"
 * Output: 5
 * Explanation: Inserting 5 characters the string becomes "leetcodocteel".
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "g"
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: s = "no"
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= s.length <= 500
 * All characters of s are lower case English letters.
