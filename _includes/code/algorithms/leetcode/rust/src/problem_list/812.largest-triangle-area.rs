 * Total Submissions: 40.4K
 * Testcase Example:  '[[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]'
 *
 * You have a list of points in the plane. Return the area of the largest
 * triangle that can be formed by any 3 of the points.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * Input: points = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[0,2],[2,0]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 
 * The five points are show in the figure below. The red triangle is the
 * largest.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Notes: 
 * 
 * 
 * 3 <= points.length <= 50.
 * No points will be duplicated.
 * -50 <= points[i][j] <= 50.
 * Answers within 10^-6 of the true value will be accepted as correct.
