 * Testcase Example:  '[1,2,3]'
 *
 * Implement next permutation, which rearranges numbers into the
 * lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers.
 * 
 * If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest
 * possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
 * 
 * The replacement must be in place and use only constantÂ extra memory.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3]
 * Output: [1,3,2]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3,2,1]
 * Output: [1,2,3]
 * Example 3:
 * Input: nums = [1,1,5]
 * Output: [1,5,1]
 * Example 4:
 * Input: nums = [1]
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 100
 * 0 <= nums[i] <= 100
