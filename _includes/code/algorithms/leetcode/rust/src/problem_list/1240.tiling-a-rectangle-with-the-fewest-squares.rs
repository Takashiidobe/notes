 *
 * Given a rectangle of size n x m, find the minimum number of integer-sided
 * squares that tile the rectangle.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 2, m = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: 3 squares are necessary to cover the rectangle.
 * 2 (squares of 1x1)
 * 1 (square of 2x2)
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 5, m = 8
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 11, m = 13
 * Output: 6
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= n <= 13
 * 1 <= m <= 13
