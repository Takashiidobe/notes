 *
 * All DNA is composed of a series of nucleotides abbreviated as 'A', 'C', 'G',
 * and 'T', for example: "ACGAATTCCG". When studying DNA, it is sometimes
 * useful to identify repeated sequences within the DNA.
 * 
 * Write a function to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that
 * occur more than once in a DNA molecule.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * Input: s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"
 * Output: ["AAAAACCCCC","CCCCCAAAAA"]
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "AAAAAAAAAAAAA"
 * Output: ["AAAAAAAAAA"]
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 0 <= s.length <= 10^5
 * s[i] is 'A', 'C', 'G', or 'T'.
