 *
 * Given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance. A pair of two
 * different leaf nodes of a binary tree is said to be good if the length of
 * the shortest path between them is less than or equal to distance.
 * 
 * Return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], distance = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The leaf nodes of the tree are 3 and 4 and the length of the
 * shortest path between them is 3. This is the only good pair.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], distance = 3
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The good pairs are [4,5] and [6,7] with shortest path = 2. The
 * pair [4,6] is not good because the length of ther shortest path between them
 * is 4.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2], distance = 3
 * Output: 1
 * Explanation: The only good pair is [2,5].
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [100], distance = 1
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: root = [1,1,1], distance = 2
 * Output: 1
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 2^10].
 * Each node's value is between [1, 100].
 * 1 <= distance <= 10
