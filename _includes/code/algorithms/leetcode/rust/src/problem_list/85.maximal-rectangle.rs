 *
 * Given a rows x colsÂ binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest
 * rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix =
 * [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
 * Output: 6
 * Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.

 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = []
 * Output: 0
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [["0"]]

 * Example 5:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: matrix = [["0","0"]]
 * Output: 0

 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * rows == matrix.length
 * cols == matrix.length
 * 0 <= row, cols <= 200
