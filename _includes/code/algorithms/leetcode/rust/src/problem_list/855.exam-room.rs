 * algorithms
 * Medium (43.32%)
 * Total Accepted:    34.5K
 * Total Submissions: 79.5K
 * Testcase Example:  '["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"]\n' +
  '[[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]'
 *
 * In an exam room, there are N seats in a single row, numbered 0, 1, 2, ...,
 * N-1.
 * 
 * When a student enters the room, they must sit in the seat that maximizes the
 * distance to the closest person.  If there are multiple such seats, they sit
 * in the seat with the lowest number.  (Also, if no one is in the room, then
 * the student sits at seat number 0.)
 * 
 * Return a class ExamRoom(int N) that exposes two functions: ExamRoom.seat()
 * returning an int representing what seat the student sat in, and
 * ExamRoom.leave(int p) representing that the student in seat number p now
 * leaves the room.  It is guaranteed that any calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) have
 * a student sitting in seat p.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: ["ExamRoom","seat","seat","seat","seat","leave","seat"],
 * [[10],[],[],[],[],[4],[]]
 * Output: [null,0,9,4,2,null,5]
 * Explanation:
 * ExamRoom(10) -> null
 * seat() -> 0, no one is in the room, then the student sits at seat number 0.
 * seat() -> 9, the student sits at the last seat number 9.
 * seat() -> 4, the student sits at the last seat number 4.
 * seat() -> 2, the student sits at the last seat number 2.
 * leave(4) -> null
 * seat() -> 5, the student sits at the last seat number 5.
 * 
 * 
 * ​​​​​​​
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= N <= 10^9
 * ExamRoom.seat() and ExamRoom.leave() will be called at most 10^4 times
 * across all test cases.
 * Calls to ExamRoom.leave(p) are guaranteed to have a student currently
 * sitting in seat number p.
