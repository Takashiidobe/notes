 * Testcase Example:  '["MyStack","push","push","top","pop","empty"]\n[[],[1],[2],[],[],[]]'
 *
 * Implement a last in first out (LIFO) stack using only two queues. The
 * implemented stack should support all the functions of a normal queue (push,
 * top, pop, and empty).
 * 
 * Implement the MyStack class:
 * 
 * 
 * void push(int x) Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
 * int pop() Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns it.
 * int top() Returns the element on the top of the stack.
 * boolean empty() Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Notes:
 * 
 * 
 * You must use only standard operations of a queue, which means only push to
 * back, peek/pop from front, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 * Depending on your language, the queue may not be supported natively. You may
 * simulate a queue using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as you
 * use only a queue's standard operations.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow-up: Can you implement the stack such that each operation is amortized
 * O(1) time complexity? In other words, performing n operations will take
 * overall O(n) time even if one of those operations may take longer.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input
 * ["MyStack", "push", "push", "top", "pop", "empty"]
 * [[], [1], [2], [], [], []]
 * Output
 * [null, null, null, 2, 2, false]
 * 
 * Explanation
 * MyStack myStack = new MyStack();
 * myStack.push(1);
 * myStack.push(2);
 * myStack.top(); // return 2
 * myStack.pop(); // return 2
 * myStack.empty(); // return False
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= x <= 9
 * At most 100Â calls will be made to push, pop, top, and empty.
 * All the calls to pop and top are valid.
 *
